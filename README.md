## Introduction
The stock market plays a crucial role in determining a company’s value and its position in the market. This analysis of Walmart’s stock data provides insights into its price movements, volatility, and financial health over time. By analyzing historical trends, we aim to identify patterns that can help investors make informed decisions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - yfinance (optional, for data collection)
  - scikit-learn (for potential predictive modeling)

## Data Collection
The stock data was sourced using the Yahoo Finance API via the `yfinance` Python package, or alternatively, through CSV files of historical stock data. The dataset includes:
- **Date**: The date of each trading session.
- **Open**: The stock price at the beginning of the trading session.
- **Close**: The stock price at the end of the trading session.
- **High**: The highest price reached during the trading session.
- **Low**: The lowest price during the trading session.
- **Volume**: The total number of shares traded during the session.

## Data Exploration
During the exploratory data analysis (EDA), we examined:
- **Time-Series Trends**: Analysis of price movements over time, focusing on long-term and short-term trends.
- **Moving Averages**: Calculation of moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day) to smooth out price volatility and identify trends.
- **Stock Volatility**: Calculated stock price volatility using standard deviation and visualized it over time.
- **Price Distributions**: Explored the frequency of price levels using histograms.

## Key Metrics
- **Daily Returns**: Calculated the percentage change in the stock’s price on a day-to-day basis to understand volatility.
- **Cumulative Returns**: Tracked cumulative returns over a given period to understand long-term stock performance.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated correlations between Walmart’s stock price and broader market indices (e.g., S&P 500).

## Results and Visualizations
The following visualizations were generated to better understand Walmart’s stock behavior:
- **Stock Price Trends**: Line plots showing the stock’s opening and closing prices over time.
- **Moving Averages**: Plots displaying 50-day and 200-day moving averages superimposed on the stock price chart to highlight trends.
- **Volatility Plots**: Visualizations showcasing the stock’s price fluctuations over time.
- **Daily and Cumulative Returns**: Charts displaying daily price changes and overall returns over the analysis period.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides key insights into Walmart’s stock performance over time, highlighting periods of significant growth, volatility, and correlation with market trends. These findings can help investors and analysts better understand the stock’s behavior and inform future investment strategies.
